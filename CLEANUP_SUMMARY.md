# Pong Game Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup performed to remove all Pong-related code and prepare the project for implementing a new game.

## Files Removed

1. **`src/game/PongScene.h`** - Complete Pong scene header
2. **`src/game/PongScene.cpp`** - Complete Pong scene implementation

## Files Modified

### `src/game/Game.h`
- Removed forward declarations for `PongScene` class
- Cleaned up duplicate forward declarations

### `src/game/Game.cpp`
- Removed `#include "PongScene.h"`
- Changed `init()` method to start with `MenuScene` instead of `PongScene`
- Updated `handleInput()` method to remove all PongScene-specific input handling
- Simplified scene transitions:
  - ENTER key: Menu → GameScene
  - ESC key: GameScene → Menu
  - Removed TAB key alternative and PongScene references

### `src/main.cpp`
- Changed startup message from "Starting Pong Game" to "Starting Game"

### `src/ecs/events/InputEvents.h`
- Removed `TO_PONG` from `SceneTransition::Type` enum

### `src/game/GameScene.h`
- Completely replaced with a clean template for new game development
- Removed all concrete game logic (player, enemies, health system, etc.)
- Added template structure with commented examples
- Changed background color from green to blue
- Added helpful comments for implementing new game features

### `CMakeLists.txt`
- Removed `src/game/PongScene.cpp` from the build configuration

## Current Project State

The project now has a clean structure ready for new game development:

1. **MenuScene** - Clean menu system (unchanged)
2. **GameScene** - Empty template ready for new game implementation
3. **Scene System** - Fully functional ECS-based scene management
4. **Input System** - Working input handling through ECS
5. **Rendering System** - 2D rendering with OpenGL backend

## How to Implement a New Game

The `GameScene` class now serves as a template. To implement your new game:

1. **Define Game Entities**: Add entity variables in the private section
2. **Set Resources**: Uncomment and modify resource loading in `onAttach()`
3. **Create Entities**: Implement entity creation in `createGameEntities()`
4. **Add Game Logic**: Implement your game rules in `updateGameLogic()`
5. **Handle Input**: Implement input handling in `handleGameInput()`
6. **Custom Rendering**: Add any special rendering in `render2DCustom()` (optional)

## Architecture Overview

The cleaned project maintains the sophisticated architecture:

- **ECS (Entity Component System)** for game object management
- **Scene System** with 2D rendering capabilities
- **Input System** with state management and event handling
- **Resource Management** for textures and sounds
- **OpenGL Backend** with 2D renderer

## Testing

The cleanup was tested and verified:
- ✅ Project compiles successfully
- ✅ Application starts with MenuScene
- ✅ Scene system functions properly
- ✅ Rendering system works correctly
- ✅ No Pong-related code remains in the main application

The project is now ready for implementing your new game!
